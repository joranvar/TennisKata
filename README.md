Evaluation
----------

It was fun to not write tests for the requirements, but just encode the requirements directly.
It was also fun to add some property tests.  I could think of only two.  Maybe I can think of more, next time.

I should try and run the tests of last time on this implementation, just to see if I missed something, but I /do/ think the code is quite clear, and it reads the same as the requirements, actually.
