TennisKata

Evaluation
----------

Everything seemed to go more fluently, today.  But that is mostly, I
guess, because I just followed the described steps blindly.  All the
requirements were met (say the tests), and I did not add any extra use
cases in the domain when they were not yet needed (except for the
`Player` type, that one was there one step too early).

The result is, deuce is represented as `Game Forty Forty`.  The rules
don't seem as complicated as last time, and I guess they could even
easily be reordered into a more logical flow.

Going back to `Game Forty Forty` after `Advantage` seems a bit
strange, though.

I still didn't have time left for some more generic properties.  I
will try again tomorrow, and see if I can come up with generic
properties that make the Tennis Kata more elegant :)
