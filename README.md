TennisKata
==========

This time, the kata went really well.  The only thing I know I miss, is the replacement of Forty-Forty by Deuce.

Defining the domain and following the simple tests, really helps.  I think the definition of `score` reads well, although I do not like that the `Game` state is the "catchall" at the end.
